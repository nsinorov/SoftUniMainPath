Write a program that receives a total of 4 parameters in the format x1, y1, x2, y2. Check if the distance between each point (x, y) and the beginning of the Cartesian coordinate system (0, 0) is valid. A distance between two points is considered valid if it is an integer value. 

Note: You can use the following formula to help you calculate the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
