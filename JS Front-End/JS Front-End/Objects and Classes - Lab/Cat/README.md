Write a function that receives array of strings in the following format '{cat name} {age}'.

Create a Cat class that receives in the constructor the name and the age parsed from the input. 

It should also have a method named "meow" that will print "{cat name}, age {age} says Meow" on the console.

For each of the strings provided, you must create a cat object and invoke the .meow () method.
