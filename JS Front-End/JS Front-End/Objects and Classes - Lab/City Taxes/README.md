This task is an extension of Problem 1, you may use your solution from that task as a base.

You will receive a city’s name (string), population (number), and treasury (number) as arguments, which you will need to set as properties of an object and return it. In addition to the input parameters, the object must have a property tax-rate with an initial value of 10, and three methods for managing the city:

    collectTaxes() - Increase treasury by population * taxRate
    applyGrowth(percentage) - Increase population by given percentage
    applyRecession(percentage) - Decrease treasury by given percentage

Round down the values after each calculation.

### Input:

Your solution will receive three valid parameters. The methods that expect parameters will be tested with valid input.

### Output:

Return an object as described above. The methods of the object modify the object and don’t return anything.
