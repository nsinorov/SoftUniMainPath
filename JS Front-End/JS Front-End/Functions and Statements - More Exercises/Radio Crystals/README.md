You need to write a JS program that monitors the current thickness of the crystal and recommends the next procedure that will bring it closer to the desired frequency. To reduce waste and the time it takes to make each crystal your program needs to complete the process with the least number of operations.

Each operation takes the same amount of time, but since they are done at different parts of the factory, the crystals have to be transported and thoroughly washed every time an operation different from the previous must be performed, so this must also be taken into account. When determining the order, always attempt to start from the operation that removes the largest amount of material.
