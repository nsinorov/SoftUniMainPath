Write a JS function that receives some commands. Depending on the command, add or subtract a percentage of how much the car is cleaned or dirty. Start from 0. The first command will always be 'soap':

    soap – add 10 to the value
    water – increase the value by 20%
    vacuum cleaner – increase the value by 25%
    mud – decrease the value by 10%

The input comes as an array of strings. When finished cleaning the car, print the resulting value in the format:

   `The car is {value}% clean.`

Note: The value should be rounded to the second decimal point.
