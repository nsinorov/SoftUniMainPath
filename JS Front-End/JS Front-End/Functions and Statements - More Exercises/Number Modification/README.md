Write a JS program that changes a number until the average of all its digits is not higher than 5. To modify the number, your program should append a 9 to the end of the number, when the average value of all its digits is higher than 5 the program should stop appending. 

The input is a single number.

The output should consist of a single number - the final modified number which has an average value of all its digits higher than 5. The output should be printed on the console.

### Constraints:

     The input number will consist of no more than 6 digits.
     The input will be a valid number (there will be no leading zeroes).

### Examples:
