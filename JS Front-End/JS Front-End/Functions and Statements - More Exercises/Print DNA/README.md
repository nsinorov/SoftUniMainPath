Write a JS program that prints a DNA helix with a length, specified by the user. The helix has a repeating structure, but the symbol in the chain follows the sequence ATCGTTAGGG. See the examples for more information.

The input comes as a single number. It represents the length of the required helix.

The output is the completed structure, printed on the console.
