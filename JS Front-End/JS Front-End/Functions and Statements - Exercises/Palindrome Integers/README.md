A palindrome is a number, which reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a function, which receives an array of positive integers and checks if each integer is a palindrome or not.


### Output:

     If the current integer is a palindrome, print: "true"
     Otherwise, print: "false"
