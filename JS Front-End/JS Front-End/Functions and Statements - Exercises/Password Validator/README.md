Write a function that checks if a given password is valid. Password validations are:

     The length should be 6 - 10 characters (inclusive)
     It should consist only of letters and digits
     It should have at least 2 digits

If a password is a valid print: "Password is valid".

If it is NOT valid, for every unfulfilled rule print a message:

      "Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"
      "Password must consist only of letters and digits"
      "Password must have at least 2 digits"
