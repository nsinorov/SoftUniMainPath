Write a function that determines whether based on the given age a person is: baby, child, teenager, adult, elder.

The input comes as a single number parameter. The bounders are:

     0-2 (age) – is a baby; 
     3-13 (age) – is a child; 
     14-19 (age) – is a teenager;
     20-65 (age) – is an adult;
     >=66 (age) – is an elder; 
     
     In all other cases print – "out of bounds";
 
The output should be printed to the console.
