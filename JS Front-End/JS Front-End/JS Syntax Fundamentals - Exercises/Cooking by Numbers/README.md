Write a program that receives 6 parameters which are a number and a list of five operations. Perform the operations sequentially by starting with the input number and using the result of every operation as a starting point for the next one. Print the result of every operation in order. The operations can be one of the following:

     chop - divide the number by two
     dice - square root of a number
     spice - add 1 to the number
     bake - multiply number by 3
     fillet - subtract 20% from the number
     
The input comes as 6 string elements. The first element is the starting point and must be parsed to a number. The remaining 5 elements are the names of the operations to be performed.

The output should be printed on the console.
