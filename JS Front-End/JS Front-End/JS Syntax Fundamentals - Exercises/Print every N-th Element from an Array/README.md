The input comes as two parameters – an array of strings and a number. The second parameter is N – the step.

The output is every element on the N-th step starting from the first one. If the step is 3, you need to return the 1-st, the 4-th, the 7-th … and so on, until you reach the end of the array.

The output is the return value of your function and must be an array.
