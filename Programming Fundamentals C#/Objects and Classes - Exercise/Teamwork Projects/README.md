It's time for the teamwork projects and you are responsible for gathering the teams. First, you will receive an integer â€“ the count of the teams you will have to register. You will be given a user and a team, separated with "-".  The user is the creator of the team. For every newly created team you should print a message: 

    "Team {teamName} has been created by {user}!".
