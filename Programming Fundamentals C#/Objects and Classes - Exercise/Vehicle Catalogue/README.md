Until you receive the "End" command, you will be receiving lines of input in the following format

    "{typeOfVehicle} {model} {color} {horsepower}"

When you receive the "End" command, you will start receiving information about some vehicles.

For every vehicle, print out the information about it in the following format:

    "Type: {typeOfVehicle}
    Model: {modelOfVehicle}
    Color: {colorOfVehicle}
    Horsepower: {horsepowerOfVehicle}"

When you receive the "Close the Catalogue" command, print out the average horsepower of the cars and the average horsepower of the trucks in the format:

    "{typeOfVehicles} have average horsepower of {averageHorsepower}."

The average horsepower is calculated by dividing the sum of the horsepower of all vehicles of the given type by the total count of all vehicles from that type. Format the answer to the second digit after the decimal point.
