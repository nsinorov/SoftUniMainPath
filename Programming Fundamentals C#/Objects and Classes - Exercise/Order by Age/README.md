You will receive an unknown number of lines. On each line you will receive an array with 3 elements:

	The first element is a string - the name of the person
	The second element a string - the ID of the person
	The third element is an integer - the age of the person

If you get a person whose ID you have already received before, update the name and age for that ID with that of the new person. When you receive the command "End", print all of the people, ordered by age.
