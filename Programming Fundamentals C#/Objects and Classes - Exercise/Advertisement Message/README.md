Create a program that generates random fake advertisement messages to advertise a product. The messages must consist of 4 parts: phrase + event + author + city. Use the following predefined parts:

	Phrases – {"Excellent product.", "Such a great product.", "I always use that product.", "Best product of its category.", "Exceptional product.", "I can't live without this product."}
  
	Events – {"Now I feel good.", "I have succeeded with this product.", "Makes miracles. I am happy of the results!", "I cannot believe but now I feel awesome.", "Try it yourself, I am very satisfied.", "I feel great!"}
  
	Authors – {"Diana", "Petya", "Stella", "Elena", "Katya", "Iva", "Annie", "Eva"}
  
	Cities – {"Burgas", "Sofia", "Plovdiv", "Varna", "Ruse"}

The format of the output message is the following: "{phrase} {event} {author} – {city}."

You will receive the number of messages to be generated. Print each random message at a separate line.
