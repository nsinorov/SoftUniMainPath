Write a program that prints you a receipt for your new computer. You will receive the parts' prices (without tax) until you receive what type of customer this is - special or regular. Once you receive the type of customer you should print the receipt.

The taxes are 20% of each part's price you receive. 

If the customer is special, he has a 10% discount on the total price with taxes.
