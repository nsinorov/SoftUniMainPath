Write a program that reads a sequence of strings from the console. Encrypt every string by summing:

    	The code of each vowel multiplied by the string length
    	The code of each consonant divided by the string length

Sort the number sequence in ascending order and print it in the console.

On the first line, you will always receive the number of strings you have to read.
