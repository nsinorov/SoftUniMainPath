Create a program, which keeps a dictionary with synonyms. The key of the dictionary will be the word. 

The value will be a list of all the synonyms of that word. You will be given a number n – the count of the words. After each word, you will be given a synonym, so the count of lines you have to read from the console is 2 * n. You will be receiving a word and a synonym each on a separate line like this:

	{word}
	{synonym}

If you get the same word twice, just add the new synonym to the list. 

Print the words in the following format:

	"{word} - {synonym1, synonym2, …, synonymN}"
	
## Example:
