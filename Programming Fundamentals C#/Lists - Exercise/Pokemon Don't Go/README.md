Long story short:

Ely likes to play Pokemon Go a lot. But Pokemon Go bankruptedâ€¦ So the developers made Pokemon Don't Go out of depression. And so Ely now plays Pokemon Don't Go. In Pokemon Don't Go, when you walk to a certain pokemon, those closest to you, naturally get further, and those further from you, get closer.
