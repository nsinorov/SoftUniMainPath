Create a program that reads a sequence of numbers and a special **bomb** number **holding a certain power.** 
Your task is to **detonate every occurrence of the special bomb number** and according to its power **the numbers to its left and right.** 
The bomb power refers to how many numbers to the left and right will be removed, no matter their values.
Detonations are performed **from left to right** and all the detonated numbers **disappear.** Finally, **print the sum of the remaining elements** in the sequence.
