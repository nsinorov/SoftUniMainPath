Create a program that keeps track of the guests that are going to a house party. On the first line, of input you are going to receive **the number of commands that will follow**.

On the next lines, you are going to receive some of the following:  **"{name} is going!"**

•	You have to **add the person, if they are not on the guestlist already.**
•	If **the person is on the list** print the following to the console: **"{name} is already in the list!"**

•	You have to remove the person, if they are on the list. 
**"{name} is not going!"**
•	If not, print out: **"{name} is not in the list!"**

Finally, print all of the guests, each on a new line.
