The first input line will hold a list of **integers**. Until we receive the **"End"** command, we will be given **operations** we have to apply to the list.

The **possible commands** are:

  	Add {number} – add the given number to the end of the list
  	Insert {number} {index} – insert the number at the given index
  	Remove {index} – remove the number at the given index
  	Shift left {count} – first number becomes last. This has to be repeated the specified number of time
  	Shift right {count} – last number becomes first. To be repeated the specified number of times
