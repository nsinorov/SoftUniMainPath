Create a program, that **reads a list of integers** from the console and receives **commands** to **manipulate the list**.

Your program may receive the following **commands**:

•	**Delete {element}** – delete all elements in the array, which are equal to the given element.
•	**Insert {element} {position}** – insert the element at the given position.

You should **exit the program** when you receive the **"end"** command. Print all numbers in the array, **separated by a single whitespace**.
