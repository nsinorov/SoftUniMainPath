On the first line, we will receive a **list of wagons** (integers). Each **integer** represents the **number of passengers** that are currently in each wagon of the passenger train. On the next line, you will receive the max capacity of a wagon, represented as a **single integer**. **Until** you receive the **"end"** command, you will be receiving two types of input:

•	Add {passengers} – add a wagon to the end of the train with the given number of passengers.

•	{passengers} – find a single wagon to fit all the incoming passengers (starting from the first wagon).
