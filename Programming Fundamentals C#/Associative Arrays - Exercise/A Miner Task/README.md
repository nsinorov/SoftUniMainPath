You will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line. Every odd line on the console is representing a resource (e.g. Gold, Silver, Copper and so on) and every even - quantity. Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line.

Print the resources and their quantities in the following format:

    "{resource} â€“> {quantity}"
