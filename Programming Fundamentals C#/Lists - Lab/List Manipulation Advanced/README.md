Next, we are going to implement more complicated list commands, **extending the previous task.** Again, read a list and keep reading commands until you receive **"end":**

    Contains {number} – check if the list contains the number and if so - print "Yes", otherwise print "No such number".
  	PrintEven – print all the even numbers, separated by a space.
  	PrintOdd – print all the odd numbers, separated by a space.
  	GetSum – print the sum of all the numbers.
  	Filter {condition} {number} – print all the numbers that fulfill the given condition. The condition will be either '<', '>', ">=", "<=".
