Create a program that reads a list of integers. Then until you receive **"end"**, you will receive different **commands:**

	Add {number}: add a number to the end of the list.
	Remove {number}: remove a number from the list.
	RemoveAt {index}: remove a number at a given index.
	Insert {number} {index}: insert a number at a given index.

**Note: All the indices will be valid!**
 When you receive the "end" command, print the final state of the list (separated by spaces).
