Write a program that connects to your localhost server. Create a new database called MinionsDB where we will keep information about our minions and villains. 

For each minion, we should keep information about its name, age and town. 

Each town has information about the country, where it is located. Villains have name and evilness factors (super good, good, bad, evil, super evil). Each minion can serve several villains and each villain can have several minions serving him. Fill all tables with at least 5 records each.
