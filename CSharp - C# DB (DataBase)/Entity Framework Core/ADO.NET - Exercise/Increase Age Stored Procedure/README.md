Create stored procedure usp_GetOlder (directly in the database using Management Studio or any other similar tool) that receives MinionId and increases that minion's age by 1.

Write a program that uses that stored procedure to increase the age of a minion whose id will be given as input from the console. 

After that print the name and the age of that minion.
