Write a program that reads information about a minion and its villain and adds it to the database.

In case the town of the minion is not in the database, insert it as well. In case the villain is not present in the database, add him too with a default evilness factor of "evil". 

Finally set the new minion to be a servant of the villain. Print appropriate messages after each operation.

## Input

The input comes in two lines:

    	On the first line, you will receive the minion information in the format "Minion: <Name> <Age> <TownName>"
    	On the second â€“ the villain information in the format "Villain: <Name>"

## Output

After completing an operation, you must print one of the following messages:

	After adding a new town to the database: "Town <TownName> was added to the database."
	After adding a new villain to the database: "Villain <VillainName> was added to the database."
	Finally, after successfully adding the minion to the database and making it a servant of a villain: "Successfully added <MinionName> to be minion of <VillainName>."
