Write a program that receives the ID of a villain, deletes him from the database and releases his minions from serving to him.

Print on two lines the name of the deleted villain in the format "<Name> was deleted." and the number of minions released in format "<MinionCount> minions were released.". Make sure all operations go as planned, otherwise do not make any changes in the database.

If there is no villain in the database with the given ID, print "No such villain was found.".
