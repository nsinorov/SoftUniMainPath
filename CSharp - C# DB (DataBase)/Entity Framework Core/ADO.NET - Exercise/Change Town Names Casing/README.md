Write a program that changes all town names to uppercase for a given country. 

You will receive one line of input with the name of the country.

Print the number of towns that were changed in the format "<ChangedTownsCount> town names were affected.". On a second line, print the names that were changed, separated by a comma and a space.

If no towns were affected (the country does not exist in the database or has no cities connected to it), print "No town names were affected.".
