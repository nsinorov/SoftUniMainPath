The doubly linked list is a structure that resembles a list but has different functionalities. Each element in it "knows" about the previous one, if it is such, and the next one, again, if there is such. This is possible because the doubly linked list has nodes and each node has two reference properties pointing to other nodes and a value property, which contains some kind of data.

By definition, the doubly linked list has a head (list start) and a tail (list end). The typical operations over a doubly linked list add/remove an element at both of the endings and traverse.

This figure shows how the structure looks:
