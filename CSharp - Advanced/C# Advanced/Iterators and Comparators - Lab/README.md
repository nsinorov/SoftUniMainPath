### First problem: 

Note: Put your classes in the namespace IteratorsAndComparators. Also your Visual Studio project should be named “IteratorsAndComparators”, as well as your assembly name (it is inherited from the Visual Studio project name).

Create a class Book, which should have the following public properties:

	string Title
	int Year
	List<string> Authors
