You will be given an integer n for the size of the battlefield (square shape). On the next n lines, you will receive the rows of the battlefield. The submarine will start at a random position, marked with the letter 'S'. The submarine surveys the surrounding area through its periscope, so it has to climb up to periscope depth, where it might run across naval mines.
