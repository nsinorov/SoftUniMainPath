Create a program that tracks cars and their cargo. 

Start by defining a class Car that holds information about:

	Model: a string property
	Engine: a class with two properties – speed and power,
	Cargo: a class with two properties – type and weight 
	Tires: a collection of exactly 4 tires. Each tire should have two properties: age and pressure.

Create a constructor that receives all of the information about the Car and creates and initializes the model and its inner components (engine, cargo and tires).
