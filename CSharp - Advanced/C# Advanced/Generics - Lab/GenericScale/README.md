NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace GenericScale.

Create a class EqualityScale<T> that holds two elements â€“ left and right. The scale should receive the elements through its single constructor:

	EqualityScale(T left, T right)

The scale should have a single method: 
  
	bool AreEqual()
  
The greater of the two elements is the heavier. The method should return true, if the elements are equal.

### Example:
