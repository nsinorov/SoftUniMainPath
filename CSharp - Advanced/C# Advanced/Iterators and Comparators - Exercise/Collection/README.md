Using the ListyIterator from the last problem, extend it by implementing the IEnumerable<T> interface, implement all methods desired by the interface manually. Use yield return for the GetEnumerator() method. Add a new command PrintAll that should foreach the collection and print all of the elements on a single line separated by a space. Your program should catch any exceptions thrown because of validations and print their messages instead.

### Input:

	Input will come from the console as lines of commands. 
	The first line will always be the Create command in the input. 
	The last command received will always be the END command.

### Output:

	For every command from the input (except for the END and Create commands), print the result of that command on the console, each on a new line. 
	In the case of Move or HasNext commands print the return value of the method.
	In the case of a Print command, you don't have to do anything additional as the method itself should already print on the console.
 	In the case of a PrintAll command, you should print all of the elements on a single line separated by spaces. 

### Constraints:
	
	Do NOT use the GetEnumerator() method from the base class. Use your implementation using "yield return".
	There will always be only one Create command and it will always be the first command passed.
	The number of commands received will be between [1â€¦100].
	The last command will always be the only END command.
