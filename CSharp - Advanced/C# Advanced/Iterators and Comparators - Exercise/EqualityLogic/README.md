Create a class Person holding a name and an age. A person with the same name and age should be considered the same. Override any methods needed to enforce this logic. Your class should work with both standards and hashed collections. Create a SortedSet and a HashSet of type Person. You will receive n â€“ the number of input lines. On each of them, you will receive info about the people in the following format:

    "<name> <age>"
  
You should add the people to both sets. In the end, you should print the size of the sorted set and then the size of the HashSet.

### Input:

	On the first line of input, you will receive a number n. 
	On each of the next n lines, you will receive information about people in the described format. 

### Output:

	The output should consist of exactly two lines. 
	On the first one you should print the size of the sorted set.
	On the second - the size of the HashSet.
