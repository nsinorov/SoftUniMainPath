Write a program that reads a list of words from a given file (e. g. words.txt) and finds how many times each of the words occurs in another file (e. g. text.txt). Matching should be case-insensitive. The result should be written to an output text file (e. g. output.txt). Sort the words by frequency in descending order.

## Examples:
