Write a program that reads the contents of two input text files (e. g. input1.txt and input2.txt) and merges them line by line together into a third text file (e. g. output.txt). The merging is done as follows:

	Line 1 from input1.txt
	Line 1 from input2.txt
	Line 2 from input1.txt
	Line 2 from input2.txt
	â€¦
  
If some of the files have more lines than the other, append at the end of the output the lines, which cannot be matched with the other file.

## Examples:
