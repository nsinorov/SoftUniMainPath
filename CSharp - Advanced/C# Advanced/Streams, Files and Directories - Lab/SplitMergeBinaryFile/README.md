You are given an input binary file (e. g. example.png). Write a program to split it into two equal-sized files (e. g. part-1.bin and part-2.bin). When the input file size is an odd number, the first part should be 1 byte bigger than the second.

After splitting the input file, join the obtained files into a new file (e. g. example-joined.png). The obtained result file should be the same as the initial input file.
