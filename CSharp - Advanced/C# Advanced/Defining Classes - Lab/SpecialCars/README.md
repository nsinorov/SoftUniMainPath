This is the final and most interesting problem in this lab. Until you receive the command "No more tires", you will be given tire info in the format:

       {year} {pressure}
       {year} {pressure}
        …
        "No more tires"

You have to collect all the tires provided. Next, until you receive the command "Engines done" you will be given engine info and you also have to collect all that info:

       {horsePower} {cubicCapacity} 
       {horsePower} {cubicCapacity} 
       …
