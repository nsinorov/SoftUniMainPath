## Create a program that:

	Reads an input of integer numbers and adds them to a stack.
	Reads and executes commands until "end" is received.
	Process the following commands:
      Add <n1> <n2>: pushes two numbers into the stack
      Remove <n>: removes the n elements from the stack or does nothing if the stack holds less than n elements.
    Prints the sum of the remaining elements of the stack.

## Examples:
