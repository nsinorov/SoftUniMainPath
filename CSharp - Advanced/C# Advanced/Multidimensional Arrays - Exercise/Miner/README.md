We get as input the size of the field in which our miner moves. The field is always a square. After that, we will receive the commands which represent the directions in which the miner should move. The miner starts from position – 's'. 

The commands will be: left, right, up, and down. If the miner has reached a side edge of the field and the next command indicates that he has to get out of the field, he must remain in his current position and ignore the current command. The possible characters that may appear on the screen are:

	* – a regular position on the field
	e – the end of the route.
	c  - coal
	s - the place where the miner starts
