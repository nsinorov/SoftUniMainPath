Create a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the first name, whose sum of characters is equal to or larger than a given number N, which will be given on the first line. Use a function that accepts another function as one of its parameters. Start by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the program. Something along the lines of Func<string, int, bool>. Afterward, create your main function which should accept the first function as one of its parameters.
