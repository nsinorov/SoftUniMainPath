### Hints:

	Use a nested dictionary (string  (Dictionary  List<string>)) .
	Check if the continent exists before adding the country. If it doesn't, add it to the dictionary.
	Check if the country exists before adding the city. If it doesn't, add it to the dictionary.
	Pass through all key-value pairs in the dictionary and the values' key-value pairs and print the results.
