Create a program that prints information about food shops in Sofia and the products they store. Until the "Revision" command is received, you will be receiving input in the format: "{shop}, {product}, {price}".
Keep in mind that if you receive a shop you already have received, you must collect its product information.

Your output must be ordered by shop name and must be in the format:

     "{shop}->

  Product: {product}, Price: {price}"

Note: The price should not be rounded or formatted.
