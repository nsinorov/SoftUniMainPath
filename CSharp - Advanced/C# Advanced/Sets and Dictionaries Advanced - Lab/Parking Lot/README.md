Create a program that:

	Records a car number for every car that enters the parking lot.
	Removes a car number when the car leaves the parking lot.
  
The input will be a string in the format: "direction, carNumber". You will be receiving commands until the "END" command is given.

Print the car numbers of the cars, which are still in the parking lot:

### Hints:

	Car numbers are unique.
	Before printing, first check if the set has any elements.
