Write a program that creates a ZIP file (archive), holding a given input file, and extracts the ZIP-ed file from the archive into in separate output file.

	Use the copyMe.png file from your resources as input and zip it into a ZIP file of your choice, e. g. archive.zip.
	Extract the file from the archive into a new file of your choice, e. g. extracted.png.

If your code works correctly, the input and output files should be the same.

Hints

	Use the ZipFile class.
	The entry in the ZIP file should hold the file name only without its path.
