Write a program that receives an integer N on the first line. On the next N lines, read pairs of "[name], [age]". Then read three lines:

	Condition - "younger" (<) or "older" (>=)
	Age threshold - integer
	Format - "name", "age" or "name age"

Depending on the condition, print the correct pairs in the correct format. Don't use the built-in functionality from .NET. Create your own methods.
