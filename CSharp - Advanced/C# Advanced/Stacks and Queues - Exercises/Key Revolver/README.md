Our favorite super-spy action hero Sam is back from his mission in another exam, and this time he has an even more difficult task. He needs to unlock a safe. The problem is that the safe is locked by several locks in a row, which all have varying sizes.

Our hero possesses a special weapon though, called the Key Revolver, with special bullets. Each bullet can unlock a lock with a size equal to or larger than the size of the bullet. The bullet goes into the keyhole, then explodes, destroying it. Sam doesn't know the size of the locks, so he needs to just shoot at all of them until the safe run out of locks.

What's behind the safe, you ask? Well, intelligence! It is told that Sam's sworn enemy – Nikoladze, keeps his top-secret Georgian Chacha Brandy recipe inside. It's valued differently across different times of the year, so Sam's boss will tell him what it's worth over the radio. One last thing, every bullet Sam fires will also cost him money, which will be deducted from his pay from the price of the intelligence. 

*Good luck, operative.*
