You have an empty sequence and you will be given N queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x – Push the element x into the stack.
2 – Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3 – Print the maximum element in the stack.
4 – Print the minimum element in the stack.

After you go through all of the queries, print the stack in the following format:

    "{n}, {n1}, {n2} …, {nn}"

## Input:

	The first line of input contains an integer – N.
	The next N lines each contain an above-mentioned query. (It is guaranteed that each query is valid.)
