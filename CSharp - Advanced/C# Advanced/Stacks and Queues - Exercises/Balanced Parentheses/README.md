Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced. A sequence of parentheses is balanced, if every open parenthesis can be paired uniquely with a closing parenthesis that occurs after the former. 

Also, the interval between them must be balanced. You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [.

{[()]} - This is a balanced parenthesis.

{[(])} - This is not a balanced parenthesis.
