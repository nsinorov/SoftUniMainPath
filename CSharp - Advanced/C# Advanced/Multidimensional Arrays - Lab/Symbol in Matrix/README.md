Create a program that reads N, a number representing rows and cols of a matrix. On the next N lines, you will receive rows of the matrix. Each row consists of ASCII characters. After that, you will receive a symbol. 

Find the first occurrence of that symbol in the matrix and print its position in the format: "({row}, {col})". If there is no such symbol, print an error message "{symbol} does not occur in the matrix".
