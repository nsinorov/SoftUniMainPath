Create a class Box, which has the following properties:

	Length - double, should not be zero or negative number
	Width - double, should not be zero or negative number
	Height - double, should not be zero or negative number

If one of the properties is a zero or negative number throw ArgumentException with the message: "{propertyName} cannot be zero or negative." Use try-catch block to process the error. All properties are set by the constructor and when set, they cannot be modified.
