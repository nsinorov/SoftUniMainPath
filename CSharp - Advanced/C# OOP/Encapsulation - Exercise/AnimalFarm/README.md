You should be familiar with encapsulation already. For this problem, you’ll be working with the AnimalFarm project. It contains a class Chicken. Chicken contains several fields, a constructor, several properties, and methods. Your task is to encapsulate or hide anything unintended for viewing or modification from outside the class.

Fields should be private. Leaving fields open for modification from outside the class is potentially dangerous. Make all fields in the Chicken class private. In case the value inside the field is needed elsewhere, use getters to reveal it.
