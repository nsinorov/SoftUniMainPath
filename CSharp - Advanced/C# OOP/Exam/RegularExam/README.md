# 1.	Overview

We are in the year 2100. Technology is so advanced that robots are all around us. They are autonomous and do whatever you tell them to do. They use fluidization instead of charging to provide the energy they need, so robots need to be fed.

You are working on a robot service and you need to create a RobotService project to monitor the actions of a robot. Each service has a robot that requires different care. Your job is to add, feed and take care of the robot, as well as upgrade it with various supplements.
