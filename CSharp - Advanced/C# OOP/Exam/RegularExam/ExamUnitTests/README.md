# Task 3: Unit Tests (100 points)

You will receive a skeleton with three classes inside â€“ Factory, Robot and Supplement. Factory class will have some methods, fields, and constructors.

Cover the whole class with the unit test to make sure that the class is working as intended.

If some of the methods in Factory change anything from the other classes, you should cover that functionality also. In Judge, you upload .zip (with RobotFactory.Tests inside) from the skeleton
