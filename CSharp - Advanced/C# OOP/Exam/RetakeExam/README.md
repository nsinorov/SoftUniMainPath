# Overview

You are chosen to take part in a Start-up company, which is developing an electric vehicles rent-a-car application. Your task is to create the classes needed for the application and implement the logic, standing behind some important buttons. The application must have support for User, Vehicle and Route. The project will consist of model classes and a controller class, which manages the interaction between the users, vehicles and routes.

# Setup

	Upload only the EDriveRent project in every task except Unit Tests.
	Do not modify the interfaces or their packages.
	Use strong cohesion and loose coupling.
	Use inheritance and the provided interfaces wherever possible.
  	This includes constructors, method parameters, and return types.
	Do not violate your interface implementations by adding more public methods in the concrete class than the interface has defined.
	Make sure you have no public fields anywhere.
	Exception messages and output messages can be found in the "Utilities" folder.
	For solving this problem use Visual Studio 2019/ Visual Studio 2022 and netcoreapp 3.1/netcoreapp6.0
