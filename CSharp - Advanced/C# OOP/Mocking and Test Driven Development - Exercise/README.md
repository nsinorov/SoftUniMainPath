# Description

Your good old friend Peter (the big-time capitalist) has invited you to join his team in the creation of a one-of-a-kind database.

You are ready to revolutionize the fintech industry beyond blockchains and payment solutions. You have the honor of taking the first step in the creation process. You need to implement a really fast data structure that will hold Transactions.

Transaction will hold:

	int Id – unique transaction id
	TransactionStatus Status – enumeration of work positions for the employee
	string From – the sender of the transaction
	string To – the receiver of the transaction
	double Amount – the salary of the employee
