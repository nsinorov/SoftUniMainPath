Create 3 different string collections - AddCollection, AddRemoveCollection and MyList.

 The AddCollection should have:
 
	Only a single method Add which adds an item to the end of the collection.

 The AddRemoveCollection should have:
 
	An Add method - which adds an item to the start of the collection.
	A Remove method, which removes the last item in the collection.

 The MyList collection should have:
 
	An Add method, which adds an item to the start of the collection.
	A Remove method, which removes the first element in the collection.
	A Used property, which displays the number of elements currently in the collection. 

Create interfaces, which define the functionality of the collection, think about how to model the relations between interfaces to reuse code. Add an extra bit of functionality to the methods in the custom collections, Add() methods should return the index in which the item was added, Remove methods should return the item that was removed.
