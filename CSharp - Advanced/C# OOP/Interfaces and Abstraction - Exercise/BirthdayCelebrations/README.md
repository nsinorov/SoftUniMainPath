It is a well-known fact that people celebrate birthdays, it is also known that some people also celebrate their petsâ€™ birthdays. Extend the program from your last task to add birthdates to citizens and include a class Pet, pets have a name and a birthdate. Encompass repeated functionality into interfaces and implement them in your classes.

You will receive from the console an unknown number of lines.

Until the command "End" is received, each line will contain information in one of the following formats "Citizen <name> <age> <id> <birthdate>" for Citizen, "Robot <model> <id>" for Robot or "Pet <name> <birthdate" for Pet.
  
After the "End" command on the next line, you will receive a single number representing a specific year, your task is to print all birthdates (of both Citizen and Pet) in that year in the format day/month/year in the order of input.
