Create 2 interfaces IResident and IPerson. IResident should have a name, country, and method GetName(). IPerson should have a name, an age, and a method GetName().
Create a class Citizen which implements both IResident and IPerson, explicitly declare that IResident’s GetName() method should return "Mr/Ms/Mrs " before the name while IPerson’s GetName() method should return just the name.

You will receive lines of Citizen information from the console until the command "End" is received. Each will be in the format "<name> <country> <age>" for each line create the corresponding Citizen and print his IPerson’s GetName() and his IResitent’s GetName().
