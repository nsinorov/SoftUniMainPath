Your totalitarian dystopian society suffers a shortage of food, so many rebels appear. Extend the code from your previous task with new functionality to solve this task.

Define a class Rebel which has a name, age, and group (string), names are unique - there will never be 2 Rebels/Citizens or a Rebel and Citizen with the same name. Define an interface IBuyer which defines a method BuyFood() and an integer property Food. Implement the IBuyer interface in the Citizen and Rebel class, both Rebels and Citizens start with 0 food, when a Rebel buys food his Food increases by 5, when a Citizen buys food his Food increases by 10.
