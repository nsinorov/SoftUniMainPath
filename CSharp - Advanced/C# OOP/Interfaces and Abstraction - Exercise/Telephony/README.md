You have a small business - manufacturing phones and to run your business you need to create phone software. The software should support two main phone models with the following functionality:

	Smartphone: 
	  Can calling other phones.
	  Can browsing in the world wide web.
    
	Stationary phone:
	  Can only call other phones.

You should start the project by implementing two classes:

	The Smartphone can call other phones and browse the world wide web. 
	The StationaryPhone can only call other phones.
  
You should also implement interfaces for each class with the appropriate methods.
