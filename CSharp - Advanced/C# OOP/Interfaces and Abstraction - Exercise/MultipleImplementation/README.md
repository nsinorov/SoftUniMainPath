NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace PersonInfo.

Using the code from the previous task, define an interface IIdentifiable with a string property Id and an interface IBirthable with a string property Birthdate and implement them in the Citizen class. Rewrite the Citizen constructor to accept the new parameters.
