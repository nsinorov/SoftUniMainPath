You need a public class StartUp.Create a hierarchy of Animals. Your program should have three different animals – Dog, Frog, and Cat. Deeper in the hierarchy you should have two additional classes – Kitten and Tomcat.

Kittens are female and Tomcats are male. All types of animals should be able to produce some kind of sound - ProduceSound().
For example, the dog should be able to bark. Your task is to model the hierarchy and test its functionality. Create an animal of each kind and make them all produce sound.

### Output:

	Print the information for each animal on three lines. On the first line, print: "{AnimalType}"
	On the second line print: "{Name} {Age} {Gender}"
	On the third line print the sounds it produces: "{ProduceSound()}"
