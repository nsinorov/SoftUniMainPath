NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace AuthorProblem.

Create a class Tracker with a method:

	void PrintMethodsByAuthor()
	
The method above should print on the console information about each method that is written by someone. You should print the information about the method and its creator in the following format: "{methodName} is written by {authorName}". You should be able to call your method and see the output of it as in the example below.
