NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace Stealer.

Use reflection to get all Hacker methods. Then prepare an algorithm that will recognize which methods are getters and setters.

Print to console each getter on a new line in the format:

    "{name} will return {Return Type}"

Then print all of the setters in the format:

    "{name} will set field of {Parameter Type}"

Use StringBuilder to concatenate the answer. Donâ€™t change anything in Hacker class!

In your Main() method you should be able to check your program with the current piece of code.
