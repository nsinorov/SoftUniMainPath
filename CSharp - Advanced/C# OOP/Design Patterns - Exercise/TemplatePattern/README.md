There are easily hundreds of types of bread currently being made in the world, but each kind involves specific steps to make them. Your task is to model a few different kinds of bread that all use this same pattern, which is a good fit for the Template Design Pattern.

### 1.	Abstract Class

First, you have to create an abstract class (Bread) to represent all loaves of bread we can bake. It should have two abstract void methods MixIngredients(), Bake(), one virtual void method Slice(), and the template method - Make().

### 2.	Concrete Classes

Extend the application by adding several Concrete Classes for different types of Bread. Examples: TwelveGrain, Sourdough, WholeWheat.

### Use What You’ve Done

Now is the time to test what you have done by trying to use it. In your Main() method you can do just that by instantiating objects of the classes you’ve just made. It was that simple. This, this might be something you’ve been already using but you didn’t know it was a Design Pattern.
