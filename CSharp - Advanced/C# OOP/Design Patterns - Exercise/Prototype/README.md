Your task is to create a console application for building sandwiches implementing the Prototype Design Pattern.

### 1.	Abstract Class

First, you have to create an abstract class to represent a sandwich and define a method by which the abstract Sandwich class can clone itself.

### ConcretePrototype Participants

Now you need the ConcretePrototype participant class that can clone itself to create more Sandwich instances. Let’s say that a Sandwich consists of four parts: the meat, cheese, bread, and veggies.

### 2.	Sandwich Menu

Let’s create a class that will have the purpose to store the sandwiches we’ve made. It will be like a repository.
