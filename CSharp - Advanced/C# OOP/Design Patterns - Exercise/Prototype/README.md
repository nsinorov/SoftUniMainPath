Your task is to create a console application for building sandwiches implementing the Prototype Design Pattern.

### 1.	Abstract Class

First, you have to create an abstract class to represent a sandwich and define a method by which the abstract Sandwich class can clone itself.

### ConcretePrototype Participants

Now you need the ConcretePrototype participant class that can clone itself to create more Sandwich instances. Let’s say that a Sandwich consists of four parts: the meat, cheese, bread, and veggies.

### 2.	Sandwich Menu

Let’s create a class that will have the purpose to store the sandwiches we’ve made. It will be like a repository.

### Use What You’ve Done

Now is the time to test what you have done by trying to use it. In your Main() method you can do just that by instantiating the prototype and then cloning it, thereby populating your SandwichMenu.
