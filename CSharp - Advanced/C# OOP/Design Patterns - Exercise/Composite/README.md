Your task is to create a console application that calculates the total price of gifts that are being sold in a shop. The gift could be a single element (toy) or it can be a complex gift that consists of a box with two toys and another box with maybe one toy and the box with a single toy inside. We have a tree structure representing our complex gift so, implementing the Composite design pattern will be the right solution for us.
