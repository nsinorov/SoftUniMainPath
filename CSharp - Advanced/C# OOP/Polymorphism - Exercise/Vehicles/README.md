Create a program that models 2 vehicles (a Car and a Truck) and simulates driving and refueling them.

Car and truck both have fuel quantity, fuel consumption in liters per km, and can be driven a given distance and refueled with a given amount of fuel. It's summer, so both vehicles use air conditioners and their fuel consumption per km is increased by 0.9 liters for the car and with 1.6 liters for the truck.

Also, the truck has a tiny hole in its tank and when itâ€™s refueled it keeps only 95% of the given fuel. The car has no problems and adds all the given fuel to its tank. If a vehicle cannot travel the given distance, its fuel does not change.
