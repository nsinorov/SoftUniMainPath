Use your solution of the previous task for the starting point and add more functionality. Add a new vehicle – Bus. Add to every vehicle a new property – tank capacity. A vehicle cannot start with or refuel above its tank capacity.

If you try to put more fuel in the tank than the available space, print on the console "Cannot fit {fuel amount} fuel in the tank" and do not add any fuel in the vehicle’s tank. If you try to create a vehicle with more fuel than its tank capacity, create it but start with an empty tank.
