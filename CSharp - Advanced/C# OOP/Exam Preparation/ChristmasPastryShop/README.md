# Overview

As we all love delicacies, today you were chosen to build a simple Christmas pastry shop software system. This system must have support for Delicacy, Cocktail and Booth.

The project will consist of model classes and a controller class, which manages the interaction between the delicacies, cocktails and booths.

# Setup

	Upload only the ChristmasPastryShop project in every task except Unit Tests.
	Do not modify the interfaces or their packages.
	Use strong cohesion and loose coupling.
	Use inheritance and the provided interfaces wherever possible.
    	This includes constructors, method parameters, and return types.
	Do not violate your interface implementations by adding more public methods in the concrete class than the interface has defined.
	Make sure you have no public fields anywhere.
	Exception messages and output messages can be found in the "Utilities" folder.
	For solving this problem use Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio 2022 and netcoreapp 3.1
