### Overview

The end of the last year in high school is approaching and the students will have to choose wisely their way to the future. Everyone will try to enter the best universities. You will be in the department, developing the governmental centralized ranking system. This system must have support for Subject, Student and University. The project will consist of model classes and a controller class, which manages the interaction between the subjects, students and universities.

### Setup

	Upload only the UniversityCompetition project in every task except Unit Tests.
	Do not modify the interfaces or their packages.
	Use strong cohesion and loose coupling.
	Use inheritance and the provided interfaces wherever possible.
  	This includes constructors, method parameters, and return types.
	Do not violate your interface implementations by adding more public methods in the concrete class than the interface has defined.
	Make sure you have no public fields anywhere.
	Exception messages and output messages can be found in the "Utilities" folder.
	For solving this problem use Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio 2022 and netcoreapp 3.1
