# Task 3: Unit Tests (100 points)

You will receive a skeleton with Booking, Hotel and Room classes inside. The classes will have some methods, fields and one constructor, which are working properly. You are NOT ALLOWED to change any class. Cover the whole Hotel class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended.
You are provided with a unit test project in the project skeleton.
Do NOT use Mocking in your unit tests!
