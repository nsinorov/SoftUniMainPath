You have to create a simple Hotel Booking application. It should be able to keep data about the available Rooms in different Hotels and to give information about the type and category rate of a hotel.

Guests should be able to check the room availability and bed capacity and to make new bookings. The application keeps data for all the bookings and the turnover of every hotel.
