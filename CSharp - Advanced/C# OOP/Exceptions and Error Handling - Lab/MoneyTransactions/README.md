You will receive on the first line a collection of bank accounts, consisting of an account number (integer) and its balance (double), in the following format:

    "{account number}-{account balance},{account number}-{account balance},…"

 After that, until the "End" command, you will receive commands, which should manipulate the given accounts balance:

	"Deposit {account number} {sum}" – Add the given sum to the given account`s balance. 
•	"Withdraw {account number} {sum}" – Subtract the given sum from the account`s balance.
