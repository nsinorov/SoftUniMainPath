NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace Shapes.

Create a class hierarchy, starting with abstract class Shape:

	Abstract methods:

	CalculatePerimeter(): double
	CalculateArea(): double

	Virtual methods:

	Draw(): string

	The method should get the name of class type as string, and should return a message in the format: $"Drawing {classType.Name}"
