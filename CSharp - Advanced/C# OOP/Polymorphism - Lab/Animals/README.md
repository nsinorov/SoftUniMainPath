NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace Animals.

Create a class Animal, which holds two fields:

	name: string
	favouriteFood: string
  
An animal has one virtual method ExplainSelf(): string.

You should add two new classes - Cat and Dog. Override the ExplainSelf() method by adding concrete animal sound on a new line. (Look at examples below)
