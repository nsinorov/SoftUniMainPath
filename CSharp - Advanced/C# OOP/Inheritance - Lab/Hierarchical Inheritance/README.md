NOTE: You need a public StartUp class with the namespace Farm.

Create three classes named Animal, Dog, and Cat: 

	Animal with a single public method Eat() that prints: "eating…"
	Dog with a single public method Bark() that prints: "barking…"
	Cat with a single public method Meow() that prints: "meowing…"
	Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal
