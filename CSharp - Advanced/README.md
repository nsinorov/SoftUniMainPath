# <p align="center"><a href="https://softuni.bg/modules/58/csharp-advanced/1379"> CSharp - Advanced module - January 2023 <a/><p>

The "C# Advanced" module provides an opportunity to study the .NET platform and the C# language in various aspects. The focus is on building algorithmic thinking and learning the principles of object-oriented programming. The knowledge that the module provides includes working with linear data structures and their implementation in C#, working with streams, files and directories, creating template classes, software testing and software development design patterns. 

As a result of the acquired knowledge, at the end of the module, students will be able to build large projects, navigate them and test them, applying popular methodologies and good practices for writing code.

## The module **"C# Advanced"** has two courses inside, which are C# Advanced and C# OOP.
  
1. About the course C# Advance - is that you will build on your knowledge of working with arrays by learning to work with multidimensional arrays and matrices. You will have the opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Generic concept - creating template classes and methods. You will solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), you will work with streams, files and directories. Attention is paid to the functional programming paradigm, as well as to the main tool based on it - LINQ for processing data streams.
  
2. About the course C# OOP - the course will teach you the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), working with classes and objects, using object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. Basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism will be studied.
We will go into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). We will be introduced to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. We will look at various debugging techniques. We will learn how to create and use decorators. We will focus on unit testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
